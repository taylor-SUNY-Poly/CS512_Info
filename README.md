# CS 512 — Software Engineering
## Repository Guide & Sprint 1 Deliverables

This repository exists to **show students of CS 512 what “good” deliverables look like**.  Emphasis should be placed on clear, complete, and properly formatted deliverables. Use it as a reference while preparing your own materials.

---

## Purpose of this Repository

- Provide **examples of appropriate deliverables**, written in **clean, consistent Markdown**.
- Demonstrate a **standard directory layout** you can mirror in your team repo.
- Clarify **what to include** for each sprint and **how to present it**.

> You’ll find an example submission for Sprint 1 in `sprint_1/sprint_1.md` in this repo.

---

## Expected Directory Structure

Your team repository should contain a folder per sprint. For Sprint 1:

```
your-team-repo/
├─ README.md
└─ sprint_1/
   ├─ sprint_1.md           ← one consolidated Markdown file with all Sprint 1 deliverables
   └─ assets/               ← (optional) screenshots/images referenced by sprint_1.md
```

- **A single `sprint_1.md`** file that compiles all requested artifacts.
- If you include images (e.g., screenshots of boards/charts), store them in `sprint_1/assets/` and embed them in `sprint_1.md`.

---

## Sprint 1 Overview

- **Window:** **September 24 → October 7**
- **Demo (Sprint Review):** **October 8**  
  - **Format:** Live **product demo** (no slides).  
  - **Q&A:** Classwide Q&A follows the demo. Instructor questions will focus on your **Sprint Retrospective**.

## Sprint Deliverables (place in `sprint_{this_sprint_num}/sprint_{this_sprint_num}.md`)

> Organize the page with clear headings. Include dated snapshots where specified.

### 1) Scrum Roles
List the **Scrum role(s) for each team member** (e.g., Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers).  
If roles rotate, state who held which role during Sprint 1.

### 2) Meeting Schedule for the Sprint
Include:
- **Sprint Planning** (date/time)
- **Daily Scrums** (every other day; target **5–6** total across the sprint)
- **Sprint Retrospective** (date/time)

> A simple table with dates/times works well.

### 3) Snapshots — Start of Sprint (after Sprint Planning)
Provide snapshots or exports (screenshots are fine) of:
- **Product Backlog** (as of the start of Sprint 1)
- **Sprint Goal**
- **Sprint Backlog** (committed work for Sprint 1)

### 4) Snapshot — Mid-Sprint (**October 1**)
- **Sprint Backlog** (as of ~midpoint)

> Highlight changes since the start (new, in-progress, done, re-scoped).

### 5) Snapshots — End of Sprint
- **Product Backlog** (end of Sprint 1)
- **Sprint Backlog** (end of Sprint 1)
- **Burndown Chart** (covering Sprint 1)

> If your tool cannot export a burndown, include a screenshot.  You can also plot line graphs in markdown using mermaid.  There is an example of this is in the smaple deliverables.

### 6) One-Page Sprint Retrospective
A concise reflection (≈1 page) covering:
- **What went well**
- **What didn’t go well / impediments**
- **Process improvements** you’ll try next sprint (specific, actionable)
- **Key learnings** (team and technical)
